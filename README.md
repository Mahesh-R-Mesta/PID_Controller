# PID_Controller_Algorithm
This is a simulation program.
PID uses proportional, Integration, differentiation equation.
Each term associated with constants Kp, Ki, Kd.
A PID algorithm is used in industrial control applications to regulate temperature, flow, pressure, speed and other process variables.
But In this program it simulates orientation controlling of small scale rocket using PID control algorithm.
for proper operation PID must be tune its constants Kp, Ki, Kd.   
once pid constants tunned, then orientation of rocket will stablize.  
Input to the program:
1)momentum of inertia of rocket.
2)Mass and trust of rocket.
3)proportional (Kp), Integration (Ki), differentiation (Kd) constants.
