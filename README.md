# PID_Controller
This PID contoller programming is used for controlling small scale rocket orientation.
momentum of inertia of rocket. 
PID uses proportional, Integration, differentiation equation.
It consist coefficients Kp , Ki, Kd and they must be tunned in order to work and it changes with change in MOF of rocket 
PID controllers are used in various feild to automatatic controlling, such as temperature contolling in chemical industries.
